# Assignments

The following assignments were used in the UnivNonMajorsCourse:

## Lights, Camera Action (Homework)

**ID**: `lightsCameraActionHW`

In this activity you will create a short story using SNAP!
Your short story should have, at least:

* A beginning, a middle, and an end
* One block that we did not use during lab (Explore your blocks)
* Two unique and different sprites that interact with each other.
  * Neither sprite may be the default turtle
* Ten total broadcasts of messages between the sprites
  * Must be at least 10 "broadcast" blocks

The activity is open to your creativity - tell a story, create characters, and experiment with moving sprites around stage.

## Polygon Maker (In-Lab)

**ID**: `polygonmakerLab`

[Solution](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=boyzhirui&ProjectName=polygonMaker)

**Instructions**:

Step 1:

Create a new block that can draw any polygon.It should have a total of 3 input areas for:

* the size of each side
* the number of sides
* how thick the pen is

Step 2:

Perform these tests:

1. \# of sides = 4, size = length of 100, thickness = 5

* This should draw a square

2. \# of sides = 10, size = length of 50, thickness = 6

* This should draw a decagon

3. \# of sides = 50, size = length of 7, thickness = 2

* What do you think this will draw?

## Squiral (Homework)

**ID**: `squiralHW`

**Instructions**

In this activity you will build a block, in SNAP, that makes your sprite draw a squiral like [the one below](data:image/png;base64,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).

## Guessing Game Part 1 (In-Lab)

**ID**: `guess1Lab`

[Solution](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=boyzhirui&ProjectName=GuessingGame1)

**Instructions**:

For the next few weeks you will be designing a guessing game.  This activity will get you started.

Item 1: The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 10 and continuously asks the user to guess the number until they guess correctly.
Item 2:

Make sure that your program contains the following:

* Welcome the user to the game
* Ask the user's name
* Welcome the user by name
* Tell the user if their guess was too high, too low, or correct

## Guessing Game Part 2 (Homework)

**ID**: `guess2HW`

[Solution](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=boyzhirui&ProjectName=GuessingGame2)

**Instructions**:

In this activity you will expand upon the guessing game you made in class.

Please make sure that all items from Activity 3 are included in this assignment, as well as the following:

* Allow the user to choose minimum and maximum numbers that the random number will be between
* Keep track of how many guesses the user used
* Report the number of guesses when the user wins

## Guessing Game Part 3 (In-Lab)

**ID**: `guess3Lab`

This week you will be recreating your guessing game with a twist: The user will be choosing the secret number and the sprite will be guessing.
Your final version of the Guessing Game should include:

1. The sprite asks the user for the minimum and maximum numbers for the range
2. The user must pick a number for the sprite to guess in that range

* You are choosing this in your head, not creating script. You might want to write this down just in case you forget the number you choose.

3. Make the sprite guess numbers until it guesses correctly.

* This means the sprite is guessing until the user tells it that it is right

4. Make a list that stores all of the guesses made by the sprite and use it to keep the sprite from repeating guesses.

* The sprite should never make the same guess twice
* The list should reset after every game

## One-player Pong (In-Lab)

**ID**: `pong1Lab`

[Solution](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=boyzhirui&ProjectName=Pong1)

**Instructions**:

In 1 player pong, the player will be able to control the paddle with your mouse. The goal is to collect points when the ball bounces off your paddle. The ball will bounce off of all walls (except the wall behind the paddle) and the paddle.

Click [here to open up SNAP](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=thomaswprice&ProjectName=Pong%20Starter). When you click the link, SNAP will open up an existing project.

You will add the following functionality to the program:

* The mouse will control the paddle moving up and down. Make sure that the paddle doesn't move off the screen.
* When the space key is pressed, the ball will start to move.
* If the ball is on the edge, it will bounce.
* If the ball touches the paddle, it will bounce off of the paddle in the opposite direction.
* If the ball touches the back wall behind the paddle, the points are reset and the ball is reset.

(HINT: if the mouse y position is higher than the paddle y position, then the paddle should move upwards only in the y direction)

## Two-player Pong (Homework)

**ID**: `pong2HW`

[Solution](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=boyzhirui&ProjectName=Pong2)

**Instructions**:

In this activity, you will take the 1 Player Pong activity that you completed in In-Lab 3 and continue working on it to make it a 2 player game.

You will add the following functionality to your 1 player pong activity to make it 2 player:

* Add another paddle on the other side that will be controlled by pressing the directional buttons. The paddle should not go off the screen.
* Add a second score that will keep track of the second players points. The points will be added to the second player when the ball hits the wall behind the first players paddle.
